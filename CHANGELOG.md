# Changelog

User-visible changes, newest first. Internal work is in the git log.

## 0.14.0

- System clock now derives from the E-Clock, so time stays true when ticks are not delivered
- Timer catch-up defers ticks instead of discarding them, so timers run late rather than never
- Fixed a spurious 100-minute stall report roughly every 280 seconds
- Fixed uptime and tick rate reporting wrong values after 100 minutes
- Added `netstat -h`, reporting scheduler and baton counters without taking the baton
- Added ARexx commands for interface control and status
- Bounded the timer task to 16 ms of each 20 ms period
- `bsd_WaitSelect` stack use cut from 864 to 116 bytes
